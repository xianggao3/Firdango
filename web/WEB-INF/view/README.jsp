# Deliverable 3

A user interface that will demonstrate your proposed GUI.
This is not a complete working interface, just a sequence of pages to
demonstrate the functionality (but the page to page links should work).
Each page should display your project look and feel and all forms,
GUI components and sample text should be included. For example, your
movie description page would contain static text for one movie, while the
corresponding page in your final project will retrieve and display the text
for each movie in your database.
